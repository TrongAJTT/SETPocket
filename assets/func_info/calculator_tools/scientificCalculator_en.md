# Scientific Calculator
A powerful scientific calculator with a wide range of functions, history, and customization options.

## [star_outline, orange] Key Features
- [icon:speed] Real-time Calculation: See results as you type for immediate feedback.
- [icon:functions] Comprehensive Functions: Full range of scientific functions including trigonometry, logarithms, and more.
- [icon:rotate_left] Dual Angle Modes: Switch between radians and degrees for trigonometric calculations.
- [icon:alt_route] Secondary Functions: Access extended function set with 2nd button.
- [icon:history] Calculation History: Keep track of previous calculations and results.
- [icon:memory] Memory Operations: Undo recent calculations with stack operations.

## [help_outline, blue] How to Use
1. Enter Expression: Type numbers and use function buttons to build mathematical expressions.
2. Use Functions: Access trigonometric, logarithmic, and algebraic functions from the keypad.
3. Toggle Modes: Switch between radians/degrees and primary/secondary functions as needed.
4. Use History: Press = to calculate and save the result and state.

## [lightbulb_outline, green] Pro Tips
- Use parentheses to ensure correct order of operations: (2+3)×4 = 20.
- Switch to DEG mode for degree calculations, RAD for radians.
- Use the 2nd button to access inverse functions: sin⁻¹, cos⁻¹, log⁻¹.
- Use memory functions (MS, MR, M+, M-) to store intermediate results.
- Double-tap numbers to select and copy results.
- Use EXP for scientific notation: 1.23E+5 = 123,000.
- Clear individual entries with C, or clear all with AC.
