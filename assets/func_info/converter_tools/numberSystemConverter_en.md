# Number System Converter
A powerful tool for programmers, students, and engineers to accurately convert numbers between different numeral systems.

## [star_outline, orange] Key Features
- [icon:precision_manufacturing] Precision Calculations: High-precision arithmetic ensures correct results for professional applications.
- [icon:code] Multiple Base Support: Convert between Binary, Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal, and many other bases (from 2 to 36).
- [icon:flash_on] Instant Conversion: See real-time results across all number systems as you type.
- [icon:tune] Customizable Interface: Easily hide or show bases, arrange cards, and switch between views.
- [icon:save] State Persistence: Your settings and layout are automatically saved for future use.
- [icon:science] Large Number Support: Work effectively with large integers, suitable for complex problems.

## [help_outline, blue] How to Use
1. Add Cards: Add multiple converter cards to work with different number values simultaneously.
2. Select Bases: Customize which number systems you want to display on each card.
3. Enter Value: Input a numerical value in any base and see instant conversions to all other selected bases.
4. Organize Layout: Drag cards to reorder, switch to table view, or use focus mode for distraction-free work.

## [lightbulb_outline, green] Pro Tips
- Base-10 (Decimal) is the most commonly used number system in everyday life.
- Base-2 (Binary) is the foundation of all computer systems, using only the digits 0 and 1.
- Base-16 (Hexadecimal) is frequently used in programming to represent memory addresses or color codes.
- Base-8 (Octal) is sometimes used in older computing systems and for certain file permissions.

## [category, purple] Base Systems
[#] Common Bases: Binary (2), Octal (8), Decimal (10), Hexadecimal (16) - the foundational systems in computer science.
[#] Less Common Bases: Other bases from 3 to 15, often used in theoretical or specialized mathematical problems.
[#] Uncommon Bases: Bases from 17 to 36, which are rarely used but supported for special cases.

## [center_focus_strong, indigo] Focus Mode
[#] What is Focus Mode?: A feature that helps you concentrate on a single converter card by temporarily hiding other elements.
[#] How to Toggle?: To turn Focus Mode on or off, press the camera icon located in the top app bar of the application.

## [build, teal] Practical Applications
Useful for programming, debugging, computer science studies, and digital engineering tasks that require working with multiple number systems.
