## [help_outline, blue] How to Use
1. Add Cards: Add multiple converter cards to work with different storage values simultaneously.
2. Select Units: Customize the units displayed on each card from bytes, kilobytes, gigabytes, and other systems.
3. Enter Values: Input any storage value and see instant conversions to all other units.
4. Organize Layout: Drag and drop cards to reorder, switch to a table view, or use focus mode for more efficient work.

## [lightbulb_outline, green] Pro Tips
- Byte (B) is the fundamental unit of digital information storage.
- Kilobyte (KB), Megabyte (MB), and Gigabyte (GB) are standard units for file sizes.
- Terabyte (TB) and Petabyte (PB) are used for large-scale storage systems.
- Bit units (Kbit, Mbit, Gbit) are commonly used for network speeds.
- Binary prefixes (1024-based) provide more accurate computer calculations.
