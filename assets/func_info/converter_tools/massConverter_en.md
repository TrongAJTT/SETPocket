- [icon:monitor_weight] Multiple Unit Systems: Convert between metric, imperial, troy (for precious metals), and apothecaries (for pharmacy) systems.
- [icon:flash_on] Instant Conversion: Get real-time conversion results across all units as you type.
- [icon:tune] Customizable Interface: Easily hide or show units, arrange cards, and switch between different views.
- [icon:save] State Persistence: Your settings and card configurations are automatically saved for future use.
- [icon:science] Scientific Notation Support: Effortlessly work with very large or small masses using scientific notation (e.g., 1.5e-12).

## [help_outline, blue] How to Use
1. Add Cards: Add multiple converter cards to work with different mass values simultaneously.
2. Select Units: Choose which mass units to display from the metric, imperial, troy, and apothecaries systems.
3. Enter Values: Type any mass value and see instant conversions to all other selected units.
4. Organize Layout: Drag and drop cards to reorder them, switch to a table view, or use focus mode for distraction-free work.

## [lightbulb_outline, green] Pro Tips
- Use scientific notation (e.g., 1.5e-12) for very small masses like atomic mass units.
- The Troy system is ideal for precious metals calculations.
- The Apothecaries system is used in pharmacy and medicine.
- Table view is perfect for comparing multiple measurements at once.
- Use presets to save your favorite unit combinations.

## [monitor_weight, purple] Supported Unit Systems
Supports a wide range of conversions across various systems, including:
- Metric: From nanograms (ng) to tonnes.
- Imperial: From grains to tons.
- Troy: Specifically for precious metals.
- Apothecaries: Used in pharmacy.
- Special Units: Carats, slugs, atomic mass units.

## [center_focus_strong, indigo] Focus Mode
[#] What is Focus Mode?: A feature that helps you concentrate on a single converter card by temporarily hiding other distracting elements.
[#] How to Toggle?: To turn Focus Mode on or off, press the camera icon located in the top app bar of the application.
