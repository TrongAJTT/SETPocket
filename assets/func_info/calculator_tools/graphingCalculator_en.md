# Graphing Calculator
Mathematical function plotting and visualization tool

## [star_outline, orange] Key Features
- [icon:speed] Real-time Plotting: Instantly visualize functions as you type with smooth curve rendering
- [icon:functions] Multiple Functions: Plot and compare multiple functions simultaneously with color coding
- [icon:touch_app] Interactive Controls: Zoom, pan, and navigate the graph with intuitive touch and mouse controls
- [icon:aspect_ratio] Aspect Ratio Control: Customize X:Y axis scaling for optimal function visualization
- [icon:history] Function History: Save and load function groups with automatic state preservation
- [icon:calculate] Advanced Math Support: Supports trigonometric, logarithmic, and polynomial functions

## [help_outline, blue] How to Use
1. Enter Function: Type a mathematical function in the input field (e.g., x^2, sin(x), log(x)).
2. Plot Function: Press Enter or tap the add button to plot the function on the graph.
3. Navigate Graph: Use zoom controls, pan gestures, or adjust aspect ratio for better viewing.
4. Add More Functions: Add multiple functions to compare and analyze their behaviors.

## [lightbulb_outline, green] Pro Tips
- Use parentheses for complex expressions: sin(x^2) instead of sin x^2.
- Common functions: sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), log(x), sqrt(x), abs(x).
- Use π and e constants: sin(π*x), e^x.
- Pan by dragging the graph area with mouse or touch.
- Save function groups to history for quick access later.
- Toggle function visibility using the eye icon without removing them.
- Use aspect ratio controls for specialized viewing (1:1 for circles, 5:1 for oscillations).
