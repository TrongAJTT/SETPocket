## [help_outline, blue] How to Use
1. Add Cards: Add multiple converter cards to work with different speed values simultaneously.
2. Select Units: Choose which speed units to display from metric, imperial, maritime, and aviation systems.
3. Enter Values: Input any speed value and see instant conversions to all other units.
4. Organize Layout: Drag and drop cards to reorder, switch to a table view, or use focus mode for more efficient work.

## [lightbulb_outline, green] Pro Tips
- Meters per second (m/s) is the base SI unit for speed with the highest precision.
- Kilometers per hour (km/h) is commonly used for vehicle speeds.
- Miles per hour (mph) is standard in the US for road speeds.
- Knots are the standard unit for maritime and aviation navigation.
- The Mach number represents speed relative to the speed of sound (343 m/s at sea level).

## [category, purple] Speed Unit Categories
[#] Metric System: Kilometers per hour (km/h), Meters per second (m/s) - the most common units in science and international use.
[#] Imperial System: Miles per hour (mph), Feet per second (ft/s) - primarily used in the US and a few other countries.
[#] Specialized Units: Knots (nautical miles per hour) for maritime and aviation, and the Mach number for supersonic speeds.

## [center_focus_strong, indigo] Focus Mode
[#] What is Focus Mode?: A feature that helps you concentrate on a single converter card by temporarily hiding other distracting elements.
[#] How to Toggle?: To turn Focus Mode on or off, press the camera icon located in the top app bar of the application.

## [build, teal] Practical Applications
Useful for vehicle speed conversions, flight and maritime navigation, scientific research, and everyday speed comparisons.
