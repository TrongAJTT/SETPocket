## [lightbulb_outline, green] Tips
- Celsius (°C) is the most widely used temperature scale globally.
- Fahrenheit (°F) is commonly used in the United States.
- Kelvin (K) is the absolute temperature scale used in science.
- Rankine (°R) is the absolute scale for the Fahrenheit system.
- Réaumur (°Ré) is a historical scale used in some European countries.
- Focus mode helps you concentrate on complex temperature calculations without distractions.

## [category, purple] Temperature Scale Categories
[#] Common Scales: Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F) - most frequently used for weather, cooking, and everyday temperature measurements.
[#] Scientific Scale: Kelvin (K) - the absolute temperature scale used in scientific and engineering applications.
